"Canada can out last the US/Trump in this silly unnecessary contest. In the US, if the stock market continues to fall and people see their 401K and personal wealth evaporate, they are going to get angry real fast.

To Canada they are taking this potential austerity as a matter of patriotic pride. Trump continues to insult them so their anger burns. They are willing to endure more hardships for longer periods of time. They will work to establish other markets and the bad will generated will remain for years.

None of this was necessary and Trump is driving the car off the cliff.",Negative,Negative
It feels like the US is playing with fire because China 100% has the stomach to just inject capital investments into their economy while the US is cutting food to food banks. The Republicans have no stomach to invest in America.,Negative,Negative
"The funniest part of this? China clearly has the upper hand here. Communists/socialists are over the fucking moon with this because once the pain starts to hit everyone, they will have LOADS of propaganda and talking points to utilize on how the capitalist-dominated, American-dominated world trade system is flawed and must be destroyed",Negative,Negative
"35. But yeah.

1990, exchange rate is 2:1. China 500B GDP, US 7T.

2025 exchange rate 6:1, going to 8:1. Gdp 17T, US 27T.

So while our economy 3.5X, theirs is 35x, but the currency is -3x, going to 4x.

Fucking insane advantage. You think people would buy their products if they were even 3x the cost? Or our products would not sell like hotcakes at 1/3rd the cost?

And that will go for everyone. India, Malaysia,  etc... their main competitor just gave themselves a 25% pricing advantage in the world market.",Negative,Negative
Yeah how they didn’t go about this slowly and selectively until they snowballed (IF I should say) some “wins” and keep it a controlled burn. At least then we’d boil slowly I guess .. better then this crap,Negative,Negative
"Trump has been threatening the annexation of Canada since day 1, that is not fucking normal and Americans need to be not okay with it.",Negative,Negative
">  Doesn't the US system recognise that mental iillness in a ruler is bad?

since it's essentially required, in some form, so as to be as evil as presidents need to be, probably not.",Negative,Negative
"As a Canadian he can get stuffed. 

Any Canadian politician that lifts a finger to actively help Trump in his trade war can measure their career in seconds",Negative,Negative
"I mean, they just approved a $1T budget for the Pentagon and we aren’t even actively fighting anymore. I’d say austerity is just for the poors.",Negative,Negative
"China just slapped a RIDICULOUS 50% TARIFF on ALL our goods — can you believe it? TOTAL DISRESPECT! They’re PANICKING AGAIN because they know America is WINNING like NEVER BEFORE!! Are they trying to play tough again — BAD MOVE! We’re bringing back the 100%, 200%, maybe even 600% tariffs, the likes of which they have NEVER SEEN BEFORE! Believe me.",Negative,Negative
"Stand firm; he gets a sick satisfaction from constantly changing directions and making everyone hang on his every word. If I were Trudeau, I’d impose tariffs on everything until Trump at least stops calling him “Governor.”

\- an American",Negative,Negative
Yes.  It is like choosing between two villains.,Neutral,Negative
Did you see their open thread on the conservative sub? All their users hid away and refused to answer people except for a small handful of dunces. Not sure if it’s because they’re all Russian bots or just cowards.,Negative,Negative

"I have no love for china...there pices of shit when it comes to opening their markets, while taking advantage and stealing and copying patents. But i dont see what the end game is here....china is not going to back down. So i guess trump actually wants to decouple from china. Nothing else makes sense.",Negative,Negative
"You are underestimating the cult.

When Trump's side talks about ""things will get worst"" preparing their flock for the promised land, they will follow him off the cliff.",Negative,Negative
"All numbers are from Google, if you think they are wrong - bring out your correct ones.",Negative,Negative
I’m not sure what you thought would happen when he campaigned on tariffs and also campaigned on other countries paying those tariffs,Negative,Negative

"I’m sorry, what’s your point?",Negative,Negative
They aren't backing down. Even Canada didn't back down to the US.,Negative,Negative
He isn’t even a businessman. He is a Russia asset propped up by them for the last three decades. He literally is a fucking moron with an unlimited debit card.,Negative,Negative
"This is where Trump finds out that he's fucking with people who have just as much influence as he does and actually know how to use it.

He's going to realize in the next few months that actions have consequences because he's got an avalanche coming at him from 4 sides. The financial sector, the utilities sectors, the federal employment sector and the medical sector.

Not to mention more nations are going to retaliate on behalf of zelensky. 

When he goes down, and he will, it's going to be gruesome for everyone.",Negative,Negative

"Politically we put our hand directly into a fire by letting Republicans have power again after everything thats happened the past 8 years. It needs to burn really bad really fast, or we wont have a hand anymore. A lot of suffering is the only thing that may prevent a monumental amount of suffering down the line",Negative,Negative
Learn? LEARN? Sad that that’s wishful thinking amongst his group,Negative,Negative
Trump won’t become unpopular until Americans feel his stupid decisions in their wallets. It is certain to happen though because he’s so incompetent.,Negative,Negative

"You say that, and then China, Korea, and Japan become the purple dragon overnight. 


You call these things inherent, but the EU exists ffs. The British empire and the USSR collapsed. Stuff changes. You can get fucked by the arrow of time and circumstance, and nobody is impervious.


So far, the only boot licker is like, Zimbabwe and the UK. There's a couple who are trying to negotiate, but the vast majority of the world, citizenry and state, is responding to this with a resounding unity of ""alright, well then fuck America, I guess""",Negative,Negative

"It’s honestly wild how many people here have chinas back.

They act like China is somehow morally superior to the United States.

Yet they forget at best they are committing ethnic cleansing against their own at worst straight up committing genocide.",Positive,Negative
"Number 1 is their Achilles heel.

You think India, Malaysia, and other developing countries are going to appreciate China handing themselves a 25% price advantage over them?

How about EU unions when Chinese goods get 25% cheaper and their exports get 25% more expensive in China?

That makes item 2 even more problematic.  To sell more they either push out other importers or displace local production.

Fucking predatory is what it is. Maybe the EU and others will wake up. Doubt it tho, the old neo-con New World Order is back, baby!",Neutral,Negative
