I don't really understand this comment. Trump's and putin's goal is to destabilize America. This is exactly what Agent Orange wants. Putin is the one who is winning here.,Positive,Positive
"As far as I'm aware they don't own any American roads. What you might be thinking of are stories about Chinese companies forming a public-private partnership with other companies to build American infrastructure (including roads and bridges). In those kinds of deals, the Chinese company oversees construction while the actual work is mostly done by American labor. The argument for doing it this way is that it was cheaper, and the argument against it is that it hurts local competitors and means that the more skilled jobs like engineering miss out on a chance for local training and experience cos the Chinese firms tended to use their own staff for that sort of thing.",Positive,Positive
"To my recollection this affects Michigan significantly. Granted it was only by 1.5%, but Michigan voting for Trump 2 of the last 3 elections is a bit ridiculous.

Republicans largely opposed the bailouts for the big 3. Could have cared less about the lead pipes in Flint or the bankruptcy problems in Detroit.

The high  Muslim population there thought voting for the guy who was saying he would help Isreal finish the job in Gaza was a good idea.

Now this. I feel for the people who knew better and voted accordingly, but empathy for others has waned.",Positive,Positive
"Trump really is misunderstanding the Chinese. They don't give a shit, and its an actual dictatorship who doesn't care about it's people.

Adding the fact, China will not lose face and it's now a USA vs China nationalistic issue.

Only China will win.",Positive,Positive
"Can someone way more educated than me, tell me why the conservative sub is seeing this as a win?

They seem to think it's a game of chicken and that China can't win since they export to the US more so than the other way around.",Positive,Positive
"As a America, I stand with Canada. Don't let this orange dictator push you around. Stand strong and hopefully we can move past these dark times. But for now. Kill the power. I don't blame you.",Neutral,Positive
"Trump: ""I tripple dog dare you"" - raises tariffs to a zillion dollars. 

Jamie Dimon: ""That's not a real number""

Trump: ""It is now... I will sign an executive order right now... ""

Jamie Dimon puts his head in his hands in disbelief.",Neutral,Positive
Which really grinds his gears.,Positive,Positive
"I wouldn't go so far as to say they are the ""good guys"" but the US is the one who is unreasonable and irrational.

China has repeatedly called out the US' moves as hegemonic and damaging to the global trading system.

These are the quotes from their foreign ministry spokesperson today when asked about the tariffs:

>We will not let anyone take away the Chinese people’s legitimate right to development. We will not tolerate any attempt to harm China’s sovereignty, security and development interests. We will continue to take resolute and strong measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests.

and 

>The U.S. is still abusing tariffs and exerting maximum pressure on China. China firmly rejects and will never accept such hegemonic and bullying move. If the U.S. truly wants to settle the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should let people see that they’re ready to treat others with equality, respect and mutual benefit. If the U.S. decides not to care about the interests of the U.S. itself, China and the rest of the world, and is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China’s response will continue to the end.",Positive,Positive
"The republicans are in a win win, you either earn a lot from revenue hikes and can cut taxes or you destroy the government. In either case, your goals have been met",Positive,Positive

Tariffs and their consequences are taught in high school economics courses. I’ll never understand why so many Americans think Trump is a brilliant businessman. He clearly isn’t a brilliant anything.,Positive,Positive
"> The thing is some countries have proposed a straight zero tariff agreement with the US and they’ve said no.

That's also because a free-trade agreement wouldn't ""make us richer than anyone has ever seen"" or some BS along those lines. He keeps pushing this notion that tariffs will fill the government coffers despite that history has already shown us the real effect they have on an economy. It took WW2 happening to finally undo the damage Smoot-Hawley wrought, and I don't think that letting something that drastic happen again would be off the table if this (predictably) blows up in his face and he scrambles to (politically) save his own ass.",Positive,Positive
"Basically everything we regularly buy at Walmart and target just doubled in price. If these tariffs stay in place, will we have hyperinflation due to no alternative buying sources?",Neutral,Positive
"I'm wondering if this admin will see that as a neutral or win given that Michigan, New York, and Minnesota are blue states. Own the libs and all that nonsense.",Positive,Positive
"We won't have to worry about stupidity either, when they abolish the Department of Education",Negative,Positive
"Yea, it'll hurt China.  It'll hurt us more.  China is a homogenous, authoritarian, (mostly) command economy that can weather this far better than we can.  They could completely embargo the US tomorrow and survive the pain.",Positive,Positive
"Literal bully, lol. I guess in a multi-polar world y'all are about to get a refresher course in bullying. Please let me know how you feel with Russian hegemony in Europe and Chinese in Asia.",Positive,Positive
"I mean to be fair, this sort of thing HAS been viewed as pretext for war before. It's just... **we're the aggressor here**",Positive,Positive
This might be a costly but smart move by China. Since Trump wants the tariffs to stick on all countries this might embolden the EU and other players to retaliate due to the unfair terms the US wants to get from negotiations,Neutral,Positive
"I notice hundred of posts where we all discuss the problems with tariffs or DOGE cuts! None of us would be doing this if they would tax the rich! I had to look up my facts when some told me tax cuts raise overall revenue! Go to the GAO website and see I went back to the hero of all the Repubs and it’s not true! GAO tracks the GDP and Revenue. It’s all there! We can stop discussing revenue issues with a higher rate on the rich! No tariffs or Medicare cuts , simple! Have a great day my fellow Americans.",Positive,Positive
I feel like iPhone people will just pay.,Neutral,Positive
"China’s entire economy is built off of low-cost production.

Ours is built off of high-cost goods and services.

We have zero leverage to be making the demands we are making.",Neutral,Positive
"Can someone ELI5 - I thought tariffs were only imposed on imports to a country. If Canada is producing the energy that these states need, how can it impose a tariff on an export?",Neutral,Positive
"Don’t worry, they’re going to use your lives, the lives of people you love, and the lives of the youth to make it right.",Positive,Positive
I'm just buying stocks for breakfast instead since they're getting so cheap now,Positive,Positive
"There are interprovincial inefficiencies in trade that have been pulling us down for a while; and with the unifying force that Trump has generated in Canada, the political barriers to those trade disputes are melting away quickly. Canada is going to come out of this more unified, efficient, and diversified than ever. All to the detriment of US trade/relations.",Positive,Positive
"This will get a bigly 169% counter tariff now.   Trump will obviously double it and plus one, because that's *even more* than twice as much.  ""Nobody maths like I math, people. The most mathy President there has been or will be.  So much maths.. so much winning.""    
*Quoted on way to Mar-A-Lago to golf more*",Positive,Positive
"It's going to be fascinating the new black markets that will emerge from this.  You'll see people smuggling all sorts of stuff into the US from Mexico and Canada.   When that new Nintendo Switch 2 comes out and it's Christmas time, hoo boy.  There will be a line from Erie to Buffalo of pissed off parents trying to save a few hundred bucks by sneaking into Canada to buy it.

And imagine the business the cartels will be able to venture into in California.  If they can smuggle fentanyl and entire human beings into the country with ease, imagine when the new Samsung phone comes out.  They'll be selling them at a discount in small electronics stores and making huge profits.  Tijuana will become a tariff free shopping boom town.",Positive,Positive
Doubt itll stay this way but the Market is up currently.,Neutral,Positive
"It might seem like China will lose this and give how dependent they are on their exports.

But she might still come out on top, though not without pain. China has multiple tools:

1. Yuan devaluation: Makes exports cheaper globally, offsetting tariffs.

2. Trade diversion: Sell more to non-U.S. markets (they've been doing this).

3. Stimulus: Internal infrastructure or tech spending to boost domestic demand.

4. Belt & Road: Expanding influence in emerging markets.

They also have a more centralized control over their economy and currency, which gives them more flexibility (but comes with risks, like capital flight).",Positive,Positive
"Europe understands just fine. The also understand that whether the counter happens today or next week makes no difference whatsoever, so may as well take the time to think about it.

Let China and the US bash themselves in the face for a while, we can wait.

[China has already won anyway](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/). The US just hasn't realised yet.",Positive,Positive
that's not even counting the geo-political win in showing the world it can and is willing to stand up to USA.,Positive,Positive
"At this point a Chinese hegemony is probably a lot more stable than a US one.

Donny is literally throwing China the keys to the world right now and you're all daft if you don't think that's what's gonna happen",Positive,Positive
"It’s a good thing we’re all getting fat raises after our employers get those huge tax cuts. Otherwise, I’d have to consider that such a boneheaded move was to purposely screw us.",Positive,Positive
Thank you. I remember being told that the Chinese own one of the toll roads in our state,Positive,Positive
">Canada is the U.S.’ largest trading partner in energy. According to Ford, 1.5 million residents will be affected across **Minnesota**, **Michigan** and **New York**, and will likely be hit with higher costs and a more unreliable grid.",Positive,Positive
"More than just those states

Electricity is an inter-connected marketplace with limited production.  If the supply cost increases in one portion ALL of the prices increase",Positive,Positive
"The thing is is that once those alternative supply paths are established, it will take many years for Canada to return back to US products. Trump’s moves literally showed all of US’s allies that the days of US being a consistently reliable and non-volatile parter are over and that alternate partnerships are needed as back ups. At some point when US manufacturers will start entering the market again, they will face the competition from Canada’s alternative trading partners, competition they did not have before Trump. 

No country wants to risk a potential of dealing with this circus every 4-8yrs. The economy likes stability and predictability.",Positive,Positive
