It doesn't really matter for China, if Trump puts a 10%, 100% or 1000% tariff on China. The US needs those products and parts from China, because there simply is no alternative for at least years to come. Chinese sellers will reroute products and the countries inbetween will earn money - at the cost of US consumers. US manufacturers, importers and consumers will have to pay the price if they want to or not. Higher prices will certainly dampen demand, but that will hit US companies much more than China. Earnings will go down, inflation up, interest rates up, less investment, job losses and certainly no enviroment to bring jobs to the US. Yeah, on the flipside the US will collect tariffs, but I'd wager, that farm subsidies and income loss from other taxes will be much higher.

Then there's this: the Chinese government doesn't want their people to buy US products anyway. Why should Chinese people buy a Tesla or an iPhone, when they have BYD and Huawei?

* The 2nd biggest kid _had_ been the rich kid's ""frenemy"" for a while, but now the relationship is unclear.

* 2nd biggest kid punches the rich kid in the face.

* Rich kid says, ""HOW DARE YOU! You must apologize or I will punch you even harder""

* 2nd biggest kid buffs his fingernails and says, ""don't hold your breath.""

* Rich kid punches 2nd biggest kid in the face AGAIN.

* 2nd biggest kid slugs back!

Today's US have zero morality.  It's a corrupt State where there is no rule of law.  The rich who can afford to bribe the President get a reprieve from the laws and that's all.

mghlug5,1j5g36j,"For anyone wondering what parts of the US and Canada are most exposed to this, or how/when electricity crosses the border, the EIA has excellent info showing daily net import/export by balancing area authority (the US grid is managed by ""balancing areas"" that have entities that make sure imports+generation=withdrawals from the grid).

[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63684](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63684)

Note that last year, 2024, a drought in Canada (which means less hydro generation) led to a more even balance, even some net export from the US, especially out West where California's drought came to an end and hydro generation there returned to normal.

That situation is no longer the case, so the 2020-2023 norm is most likely the case for 2024.

The US imports energy from Canada at hours/times in which it's cheapest (we have very robust energy markets for generation). You, as a retail customer, never see the actual price paid by your utility except once a year, they add up all the costs of serving all customer's load, and ask the regulator to let them adjust prices. It may be that they paid a lot in, say, summer afternoons due to heavy load from AC usage, but that's offset by, say, very cheap hydro imports in spring. Take the ""cheap hydro imports"" out, and the overall cost is going to be higher. Your utility will be asking your state regulator to allow them to increase prices to reflect the higher cost of buying energy overall. If the cost rises dramatically and quickly (and there aren't cheap options in the US), they'll ask for adjustments right away.",16,2025-03-07 10:26:48,Economics,0.20374542124542122,0.453574481074481

mgmzx1d,1j5g36j,"Canada, I’m sure, would be happy to drop the tariffs.  As soon as trump drops his.

He paused some of them, Canada paused some as well.  We also have a bunch of tariffs that were paused to match the April round 3 of this.  

But once Trump drops all his tariffs and states that Canada is an independent and sovereign nation and ally, that shall remain that way. Stops referring to the prime minister as governor, stops talking about redrawing borders… Canada will probably play nice.

But, we’re not a happy nation.  We won’t be buying US as much as in the past any time soon.  

I Think most Canadians don’t think the retaliatory tariffs  and export taxes have gone far enough.  The US administration has told some very big lies about Canada, and our allies (your allies too, at least they used to be) threatens our economy, threatened our borders, threatened our sovereignty and insulted us as a country.

Canada is in a different state.  Our economy might get hurt, by hostile foreign influence.  We will fight it to the end.  The US economy will also get hurt, but that’s what the US voted for and is failing to stop within its own borders.
